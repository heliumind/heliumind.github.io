<p>I am a <strong>Volunteer</strong> and <strong>Board member</strong> at <a href="https://www.international.tum.de/tumi/">ESN TUMi München</a>.
TUMi is part of the <a href="https://www.esn.org">Erasmus Student Network</a>, a Europe-wide student organization
with the mission to foster student mobility in higher education.
At TUMi we facilitate the social and personal integration of international students by providing support
at the beginning of their studies studies in Munich and offering a diverse cultural and orientation program
during the semester.
Through my role as TUMi&rsquo;s Local Representative I actively engage in ESN&rsquo;s large network
both on a national and international level.</p>
