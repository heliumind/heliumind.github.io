      <description>eCARus is a student organized initiative, in which around 50 ECE students at TUM research and develop in the field of electromobility each semester. Since the start of eCARus in 2009 two electrical vehicles have been successfully developed.
Check out eCARus&amp;rsquo; Image video below I feature in and also helped producing.
